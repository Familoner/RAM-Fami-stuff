EVTNAME46335;A Disfunctional Military;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46335;\n\nEver since the mid-eighteenth century the East India Company has relied in a system of presidency armies, those being the Bengal, Madras and Bombay armies. Composed of a small number of European regiments accompanied by a large number of Native regiments composed of Indian sepoys lead by European and sometime native officers. However years after the British withdrawal from India many Sepoys became disquiet or outright rebellious due to the company's exploitative economic practices, social friction within castes and social reforms previously enacted by the British such as the abolition of sati. Causing a break of cohesion, discipline and morale in the company's presidency armies. \n§R Improve your army's leadership, light armaments and logistics to get rid of this modifier;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME46336;The Breakdown of the Zamindari System.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46336;\n\nThe administration of the East India Company over it's vast territories, though growing more centralized over the years, still depended on the feudal Zamindari system in many regions to collect taxes. This system inherited from the Mughal Empire and modernized in 1793 by Lord Cornwallis worked by having Indian Zamindars bid with the highest tax rates to win ownership of a particular land, transforming local farmers tenants in their previously owned lands, if the Zamindar failed to collect the quoted tax his ownership was revoked. Now that the company lacks backing of a great power and the presidential armies have become innefective the Zamindars have gained leverage to use against the government, wreaking havoc and effectively crippling the administration. \n§R To get rid of this modifier found the Imperial Civil Service and reform your army;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME46337;Reforming the Presidential Armies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46337;\n\nThrough a harsh crackdown effort from the upper echelons of the government the most disloyal sepoys were removed from their position, arrested or even executed depending on the severity of their disciplinary transgressions, most corrupt officers who took advantage of the breakdown of discipline were removed from their positions and arrested. Discipline was restored yet there's a gap in personnel to fill, reformists within the military advocate to expanding foreign recruitment, giving generous wages to attract the most skilled officers and fighters money could acquire from all parts of the globe. Hardliners within the army object to this and would prefer we fill this gap traditionally with local soldiers and English officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
